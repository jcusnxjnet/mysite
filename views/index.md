Hi there!
</p>

<p class="pb-4">
I'm a fan of personal websites. Not the ones with business plans behind them, but real personal websites. The kind I keep searching for and visiting from time to time. When you stumble upon those hidden gems, theyâ€™re anything but boring. Regardless of the content, they always carry traces of the personalities of the people who created them. 
</p>

<p class="pb-4">
I've also always wanted a space to share my thoughts (silly and naive as they might be) and to store notes I find worth keeping. When I discovered static site generators, I realized that even I could build and maintain a website with a reasonable amount of effort. 11ty was one of the first SSGs I tried, and to be honest, it was fun from start to finish. I'm not sure if I still have a real need to publish content or if I simply enjoy playing around with it.

Either way, welcome to my personal website!
